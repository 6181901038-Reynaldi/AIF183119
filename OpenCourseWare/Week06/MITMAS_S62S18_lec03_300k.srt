8
00:00:22,948 --> 00:00:24,490
TADGE DRYJA: Hari ini,
saya akan berbicara

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:29,770
tentang tanda tangan (dijital) dan
berbagai hal yang berhubungan

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,490
dengan tanda tangan.

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,343
Di tugas, Anda
bekerja dengan tanda tangan,

12
00:00:33,343 --> 00:00:35,510
tetapi Anda bekerja dengan
tanda tangan berbasis hash, yang

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,405
sebenarnya tidak digunakan
di bitcoin sama sekali.

14
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,580
Tapi kita akan berbicara tentang itu.

15
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,080
OK.

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,630
Jadi jika Anda sudah
mengerjakan pekerjaan rumah,

17
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,810
ada tanda tangan
lamport, betul?

18
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,040
Itu adalah tanda tangan berbasis hash.

19
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,010
Dan mereka menggunakan fungsi hash.

20
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,940
Jadi itu cukup jelas.

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,940
Anda dapat memahaminya.

22
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,350
Tidak ada hal yang
super gila.

23
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,720
Kodenya cukup singkat.

24
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,830
Jadi itu keren.

25
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,340
Apa kekurangan dari
tanda tangan lamport ini?

26
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,342
Siapapun-- ya?

27
00:01:05,342 --> 00:01:06,800
AUDIENS: Anda hanya
bisa menggunakannya sekali.

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,410
TADGE DRYJA: Ya.

29
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:07,910
OK.

30
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,045
Jadi tambahannya.

31
00:01:09,045 --> 00:01:09,670
Ini adalah hash.

32
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,480
Itu keren.

33
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,570
Satu kali pakai.

34
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:18,830
Kemungkinan kekurangan lain
dibandingkan sistem lain,

35
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,350
jika Anda memperhatikan.

36
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:26,420
Lainnya adalah mereka cukup
besar, betul kan?

37
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,080
Anda bisa mengatasinya.

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,740
Tetapi jika Anda mencari
di forge?,

39
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,260
atau file tersebut
dengan tanda tangannya,

40
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,930
itu seperti, apa, 8K
untuk sebuah tanda tangan--

41
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,520
8 kilobyte-- cukup besar.

42
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,470
Kuncinya are 16 kilobyte--

43
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,400
menyebalkan.

44
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,790
Kunci privat
juga 16 kilobyte.

45
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:55,080
Jadi ya, tanda tangan 8K,
16K kunci privat/publik.

46
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,800
Itu adalah kekurangannya.

47
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,820
Saya tidak punya
slide, saya

48
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,810
akan membuatnya lebih
menyenangkan dan interaktif.

49
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,930
Apa solusi-solusi yang bisa ditawarkan
untuk masalah-masalah ini?

50
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,710
Jadi kita sebenarnya bisa
memitigasi/mengatasi

51
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,280
kedua hal ini dengan
hasil yang cukup memuaskan.

52
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,470
Bagaimana dengan yang pertama,
satu kali pakai?

53
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,170
Apa yang menjadi cara
yang cukup nampak

54
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,090
untuk mengatasi
masalah satu kali pakai?

55
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,903
Dan saya rasa jawabannya
itu terlalu bodoh.

56
00:02:26,903 --> 00:02:29,070
Jawabannya terdengar bodoh,
dan itu bisa saja bekerja.

57
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,140
Jadi ya?

58
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,200
AUDIENS: Tidak menunjukkan
potongan-potongan kunci privat?

59
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,303
Sebagai gantinya, tunjukkan hal lain.

60
00:02:37,303 --> 00:02:39,220
TADGE DRYJA: Mungkin
ada cara yang pintar.

61
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,780
Tapi itu mungkin terlalu pintar.

62
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:47,200
Sesuatu yang sangat sederhana,
OK, saya hanya bisa menggunakan kunci sekali.

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,850
Bagaimana saya bisa menggunakan "kunci"
dalam tanda kutip, lebih dari sekali?

64
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,350
Ya?

65
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,050
AUDIENS: Buat yang lain.

66
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,330
TADGE DRYJA: Ya.

67
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,540
Anda dapat membuat kunci yang lain.

68
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,500
Jadi Anda dapat berkata, saya
punya kunci publik 16 kilobyte ini.

69
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,050
Saya akan membuat sebuah
kunci publik 32 kilobyte.

70
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,040
Dan itu hanyalah 2 kunci
publik ditempelkan.

71
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,410
Dan sekarang, jika saya
membuat tanda tangan,

72
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,540
Saya cukup menambahkan bit
ekstra di depan.

73
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,870
San saya katakan, tanda tangan
ini menggunakan kunci 0

74
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,490
atau tanda tangan ini
menggunakan kunci 1,

75
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,100
dan kita mendapatkan seluruh
tanda tangan sesudahnya.

76
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,280
Dan saat Anda melihat ke
kunci publik 32 kilobyte ini,

77
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,560
dan Anda katakan, OK,
itu dimulai dengan nol,

78
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,090
berarti menggunakan kunci pertama,
subkunci pertama

79
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,580
dalam blok kunci
32 byte ini.

80
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,340
Dan dalam kasus ini,
menggunakan satu,

81
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,928
sehingga itu menggunakan
subkey yang belakangan disebut,

82
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:36,720
Jadi itu dapat bekerja.

83
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,020
Dengan begitu Anda dapat
menggunakan kunci publik Anda dua kali,

84
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,260
dengan biaya ukuran kunci
publik Anda menjadi dobel, di mana

85
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,043
tidak terlalu bagus, bukan?

86
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:49,210
Dan itu tidak terlalu efisien.

87
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,220
Tapi itu bisa bekerja.

88
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,790
OK.

89
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:58,700
Ada cara pintar lain untuk
melakukannya lebih efisien?

90
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,770
Atau tunggu.

91
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,330
Jadi OK, juga, saya
akan memberikan Anda petunjuk.

92
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:10,210
Pada kasus ini, mari kita katakan
pub (publik) sub 0 dan pub sub 1, betul?

93
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,780
Dan berikutnya, 32 byte
pubkey (kunci publik) hanyalah mereka

94
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,730
digabungkan bersama, bukan--

95
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,930
pub0, pub1.

96
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:27,270
Apa yang terjadi terhadap kunci
privat di kasus ini, ya?

97
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,000
Bagaimana kunci privat
bekerja di sini?

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,650
Sama-sama mengembang, saya rasa.

99
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:40,200
Ada yang punya cara untuk
memitigasi berkembangnya ukuran

100
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,410
kunci privat dalam kasus ini?

101
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,540
So the private keys are
the preimages here, right?
Jadi kunci privatnya adalah
preimage (asal mula) di sini, betul?

102
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,833
Mereka berkembang menjadi
blok kunci publik ini.

103
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,250
Jadi Anda bisa sekedar
bilang, OK, saya

104
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,000
punya dua kali ukuran kunci
privat menjadi dua kali ukuran

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,050
kunci publik.

106
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,520
Bisakah Anda melakukannya
lebih efisien?

107
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,020
Ya?

108
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,070
AUDIENS: Bisakah Anda cukup
melakukan hash terhadap kunci privat?

109
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,610
sehingga Anda punya 2 hash
bukan cuma 1?

110
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,400
TADGE DRYJA: Ya.

111
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,470
Jadi misalkan Anda punya
blok 16K ini,

112
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,240
dan Anda ingin ini berubah
menjadi dua kunci publik.

113
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,520
Jadi itu dasar cara
yang bagus untuk melakukannya.

114
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,730
Dan kurang lebih
akan seperti itu.

115
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,115
Bagaimana tepatnya-- apa cara
untuk melakukannya?

116
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:23,640
AUDIENS: Anda dapat mempertahankan
kunci privat yang sama seperti sebelumnya

117
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,550
dan tambahkan sesuatu seperti
nol atau satu untuk mengindikasikan--

118
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,540
TADGE DRYJA: Ya.

119
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,690
Jadi ini adalah fungsi
hash, ya?

120
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,320
Dan seperti sebelumnya, kita katakan,
OK hash dari ini adalah blok 0,

121
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,570
ini adalah blok 1,
ini adalah blok 2.

122
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,272
Jadi ide dari pub--

123
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:41,270
kita lihat.

124
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,460
Apakah ini terlihat?

125
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,287
Mungkin terlalu kecil, ya?

126
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:44,870
AUDIENS: Ya.

127
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,845
TADGE DRYJA: Ya, OK.

128
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,480
Mari kita buat ini lebih besar.

129
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,460
Maaf.

130
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:52,960
OK.

131
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:00,680
Jadi pada diagram ini, Anda sudah
punya kunci privat Anda saat ini.

132
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,030
Dan ini dalam blok besar ini.

133
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,940
Dan ada 256 darinya, tapi kita
coba buat supaya tetap kecil.

134
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,660
Dan idenya adalah ini adalah
blok 32 byte dengan bilangan acak

135
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,410
di dalamnya.

136
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,110
Dan Anda lakukan hash
untuk mendapatkan kunci publik.

137
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,832
Jadi misalkan, OK, pub2--

138
00:06:17,832 --> 00:06:21,430
dan ini adalah publik, ini
adalah privat, dan, kita katakan,

139
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,410
rahasia--

140
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:30,050
pub2 hanyalah hash dari
secret2, betul?

141
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:30,550
Tapi ya.

142
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,050
Apa yang bisa kita lakukan adalah
kita bisa memiliki dua fungsi hash

143
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,540
berbeda.

144
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,760
Dan ada cara yang sangat
sederhana untuk membuat

145
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,650
fungsi hash yang sangat
berbeda-beda

146
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,180
adalah dengan cara, OK,
hash0 sudah terdefinisi

147
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,310
sebagai fungsi hash tentang apapun
masukan x Anda direkatkan

148
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,230
dengan angka 0.

149
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:56,260
Kemudian hash1, kita definisikan
sebagai x koma 1 dan seterusnya.

150
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,670
Dan ini sebenarnya aman.

151
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,260
Anda dapat melakukan ini.

152
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,345
Ada pertanyaan atau
mungkin keberatan?

153
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:04,970
AUDIENS: Saya berpikir jika
seseorang tahu fungsi hash

154
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,763
yang Anda gunakan, bukankah
mereka hanya mendefinisikan

155
00:07:06,763 --> 00:07:09,180
x karena mereka tahu bahwa
itu tidak akan membantu [TIDAK TEDENGAR] x.

156
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,700
[TIDAK TERDENGAR]

157
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,420
TADGE DRYJA: Ya.

158
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,110
Ya.

159
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:19,140
Jadi tidak benar-benar ada entropi
atau rahasia antara 0 dan 1 ini.

160
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,420
Tetapi itu murni
berdasarkan pada x, ya?

161
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,140
Tapi idenya adalah,
yah, jika saya melakukan ini,

162
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:30,880
dan saya katakan, OK, yah
pub2 adalah hashnya

163
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,890
dari secret2 digabungkan dengan
0, yah, jika anda tahu secret2,

164
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,290
Anda bisa kembali.

165
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,330
Karena pengaruh 0 sudah jelas.

166
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,210
Namun idenya adalah jika Anda tidak 
tahu nilai secret2, maka fakta bahwa Anda

167
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:45,040
mengetahui byte terakhir dari masukan 
hash tidak akan terlalu membantu Anda.

168
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,400
Karena ada sekumpulan data ini
yang tidak Anda ketahui.

169
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,650
Dan Anda tidak akan mampu 
menemukan sebuah preimage.

170
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,540
Kamu akan berpikir, oke, saya
tahu preimage

171
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,540
untuk public2 berakhir dengan sebuah byte 0

172
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,080
Apakah nilai 32 byte lainnya
yang muncul sebelumnya?

173
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,404
Anda tetap tidak bisa kembali
untuk membuat sebuah preimage

174
00:08:01,404 --> 00:08:05,615
AUDIENS: Namun sepertinya
ada semacam--

175
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:08,470
Apa ya-- Anda akan membuat sebuah
pernyataan serupa yang mengatkaan, oh

176
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,360
Jika byte terakhir
tidak penting,

177
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,600
lalu byte kedua terakhir
juga tidak penting, kan?

178
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,620
TADGE DRYJA: Jadi serangannya
adalah saya punya pub2

179
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,320
yang adalah keluaran hash 32 byte.

180
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,820
Saya ingin tahu
benda apakah ini.

181
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,800
Sekarang, saya ingin mengetahui apa
isi byte yang terakhir, yah?

182
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,320
Itu akan menjadi,
misalnya, 33 byte,

183
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,780
dan byte terakhir itu adalah sebuah 0.

184
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,570
Dan ini akan menjadi
beberapa angka acak

185
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,500
Jadi saya memiliki beberapa petunjuk
tentang bagaimana preimage nya.

186
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,539
Saya mendapatkan informasi mengenai gambar awal.

187
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,970
Saya tahu byte terakhirnya adalah sebuah 0.

188
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,950
Tapi itu tidak
membantu karena saya tidak

189
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,160
tahu semua byte sebelum itu.

190
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,130
Jadi saya tidak bisa benar-benar melakukan--

191
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,770
Saya tidak bisa menandai karena saya
harus mampu mengungkapkan

192
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,945
semua hal ini.

193
00:08:57,945 --> 00:09:00,070
Dan cara fungsi hash bekerja,
jika itu adalah fungsi hash yang baik

194
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,722
function, faktanya bahwa Anda
tahu beberapa bagian dari preimage

195
00:09:03,722 --> 00:09:05,680
tidak seharusnya memberikan Anda
petunjuk ke bagian-bagian lain

196
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,270
dari preimage.

197
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,930
Karena itu terlihat sangat acak.

198
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:14,380
Dan menambahkan sesuatu di akhir
ini seharusnya tidak mengungkapkan apapun.

199
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,660
Ada fungsi-fungsi hash
di mana ini bisa sangat membahayakan,

200
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,840
dan Anda bisa mempertimbangkannya seperti
fungsi hash yang rusak, di mana

201
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,690
jika saya tambahkan banyak
data yang telah diketahui di akhir,

202
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,110
itu mungkin memberi saya sifat-sifat dari
kunci publik yang dapat saya temukan.

203
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,070
[TIDAK TERDENGAR],, sejauh yang
kami tahu, ini berfungsi dengan baik.

204
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,440
Sebagian besar fungsi hash
bekerja dengan baik dengan cara ini.

205
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,750
Jadi yah, Anda dapat melakukannya.

206
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,370
Dan kemudian Anda dapat
berkata, oke, yah, saya

207
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:42,710
akan menggunakan fungsi hash
0 untuk membuat pubkey 0, bukan?

208
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,020
Ini adalah pubkey 0.

209
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:50,470
Dan jika saya menggunakan fungsi hash
1, saya membuat pubkey 1.

210
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:55,910
Sekarang saya memiliki sebuah 16 kilobyte--
Saya hapus ini--

211
00:09:58,152 --> 00:09:59,985
Jadi sekarang, yang bisa saya lakukan
adalah saya bisa berkata, oke, yah,

212
00:09:59,985 --> 00:10:03,990
Saya punya kunci rahasia,
kunci privat sebesar 16 kilobyte,

213
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:10,050
tapi saya punya pubkey (kunci
publik) sebesar 32 kilobyte

214
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,927
yang bisa saya gunakan 2 kali
dan mempunyai 2 subkey

215
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:14,260
jadi saya tidak perlu menyimpan
sebesar data kunci privat milik saya.

216
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,250
Jadi itu keren.

217
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,228
itu membuatnya 
sedikit lebih efisien. 

218
00:10:18,228 --> 00:10:20,770
Apakah ada yang mempunyai ide 
bagaimana membuatnya lebih efisien

219
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,770
untuk penyimpanan kunci private?

220
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,480
Anda sebenarnya bisa membuatnya
sangat efisien 

221
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,408
dengan menggunakan ide ini.

222
00:10:30,408 --> 00:10:31,360
Ada ide?

223
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:36,600
Ya.

224
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,310
Baik, Anda--

225
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,380
Jadi beberapa petunjuk.

226
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,000
Ini sangat berguna, bukan?

227
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,190
Idenya adalah, yah,
bahkan jika Anda tahu

228
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,550
sufiks seperti apa
dari semua hal ini,

229
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,290
jika Anda tidak 
tahu x, Anda tidak

230
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,740
akan mampu menemukan 
preimagenya, betul?

231
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,540
Jadi mungkin tambahkan
beberapa hal di sini.

232
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,040
Ada ide?

233
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,600
Oh, ya?

234
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,560
AUDIENS: Bisakah Anda melakukan
hash pada indeksnya?

235
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,610
TADGE DRYJA: Betul.

236
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,110
Betul.

237
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,210
Jadi daripada hanya
mengatakan 0 dan 1

238
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,650
dapat kita katakan di sini, yah, bagaimana
kalau hanya memiliki satu bagian?

239
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:25,510
Ada satu bagian, dan
memiliki angka x yang acak.

240
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,880
Yah, ini merupakan hash dari x koma 0

241
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,840
Ini adalah hash dari x koma 1.

242
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,330
Ini adalah hash dari x koma 2.

243
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:35,830
OK.

244
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,330
Jadi, ya.

245
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,600
Jadi yang bisa Anda lakukan adalah Anda dapat--

246
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,690
ini sebelumnya, benar,
saat saya berkata, OK, yeah,

247
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,700
tapi ini pada dasarnya bagaimana cara
melakukan kunci private sebesar 32 byte dimana

248
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,040
kunci private Anda
sebenarnya cukup kecil,

249
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,330
dan Anda hanya mendapatkan
semua kunci publik

250
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,110
dengan menambahkan angka di
akhir, menggabungkannya

251
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,990
menjadi hash Anda.

252
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,240
Dan sekarang Anda seperti, OK, keren.

253
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,420
Saya mempunyai sebuah kunci private
sebesar 32 byte, dan saya

254
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,640
dapat membuat kunci publik yang
sangat besar dari mereka,

255
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,260
dan itu masih aman, bukan?

256
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,410
Karena saya dapat menambahkan angka
apapun yang saya inginkan disini.

257
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,488
Dan saya bisa melakukan ini
jutaan kali,

258
00:12:13,488 --> 00:12:16,030
dan tidak ada yang bisa menemukan
preimage, meskipun saya

259
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,580
memberikan Anda semua hash
yang berkaitan, bukan?

260
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,900
Ini x koma 0, x koma
1, x koma satu juta.

261
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,340
Saya bisa memberi Anda jutaan dari mereka.

262
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,390
Dan setiap kali saya melakukannya,
itu tidak memberi Anda

263
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,880
wawasan tentang bagaimana
menemukan x itu apa--

264
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,597
jika itu adalah fungsi hash yang baik.

265
00:12:29,597 --> 00:12:30,680
Jadi itu sangat kuat.

266
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,520
Dan sekarang saya bisa katakan, OK,
masalah kunci private sudah terpecahkan.

267
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,420
Saya memiliki 0 dari 1 pertumbuhan
di kunci private saya

268
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,670
Saya dapat membuat kunci publik
sebanyak yang saya inginkan, tidak pernah

269
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,570
bertambah besar.

270
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,112
Keren.

271
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:44,320
Namun masih ada masalah dengan
kunci publik ini.

272
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,820
Katakanlah saya ingin
menandatangani empat kali.

273
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,320
OK.

274
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,957
Baik, saya akan membuat kunci
publik sebesar 64 kilobyte.

275
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,270
Sekarang saya bisa menandatangani empat kali.

276
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:56,770
Bagus.

277
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,820
But my public key size expands
with the number of signatures

278
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,100
I ever want to do.

279
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,250
Any ideas on how you
could mitigate that

280
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,130
or how you could still
make a usable system,

281
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,060
despite this fact?

282
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,270
There's a couple
different techniques.

283
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:18,770
Any ideas?

284
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,500
OK.

285
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,180
So one would be
every time I sign,

286
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,830
I also sign my next pubkey.

287
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,540
You can do that.

288
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,160
It's got some downsides, right?

289
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,540
So the idea is I first publish
one 16 kilobyte pubkey.

290
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,620
And then I say, OK, when I sign,
I'm going to sign my message.

291
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,610
And concatenated to that
message will be my next pubkey.

292
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,040
And so I'm signing something
and also indicating

293
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,190
what my next public key
will be that I sign with.

294
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,160
Then I can still maintain
a small private key

295
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,570
and then keep signing.

296
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,690
The problem is, in order
for someone to verify,

297
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,370
they're going to need to look at
all of my previous signatures,

298
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:01,870
right?

299
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,430
So if I'm saying, hey,
here's my 500th public key

300
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,180
that I'm signing with,
here's the message,

301
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,722
you're going to have to go back
and look at my entire history

302
00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:14,000
of signing, which is not great.

303
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,500
OK.

304
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,418
So other ideas of how to
deal with large pubkeys?

305
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:20,710
What's a way you could do this?

306
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,570
So hints.

307
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,700
Is there any kind
of data function

308
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,570
we've seen here where it takes
an arbitrary sized amount

309
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,630
of data and outputs
a fixed size?

310
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,610
[LAUGHING]

311
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,250
In fact, it's the
only thing we've

312
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,750
been talking about so far.

313
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,867
So what would you do to make
your public keys smaller?

314
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:44,492
AUDIENCE: Hash.

315
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:45,450
TADGE DRYJA: Hash them.

316
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,030
Right.

317
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,530
OK.

318
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,620
So you say, well,
yeah, 32 byte pubkey.

319
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,050
Well, you just
commit to the pubkey

320
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,570
with the hash of the
whole thing, right?

321
00:14:54,570 --> 00:15:02,040
And I say, well, I've got
my 16 kilobyte by pubkey.

322
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,580
I just hash it, right?

323
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,600
And now I have a
32 byte public key.

324
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,240
And I've committed.

325
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,000
That works, right?

326
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,160
I've committed to my public key.

327
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,990
However, when I sign, I need
to provide the whole public key

328
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,570
in order for you to verify.

329
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,150
I need to provide this
whole 16 original pubkey,

330
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,620
original version pubkey,
after when I sign.

331
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:34,880
So now my signature goes
from 8K to, what, 24K.

332
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,530
So I haven't really made
it more efficient, right,

333
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:42,840
in that the total thing with
public keys and signatures

334
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,680
stays the same size--

335
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,660
actually, slightly larger.

336
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,220
But this is kind of a game.

337
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,260
Because the public
key, it might be

338
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,050
like I'm showing it
to you beforehand,

339
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,695
and we're
space-constrained there.

340
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,320
And then, when I'm
doing the signature,

341
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,960
I have more space or time
or something like that.

342
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,250
So this is actually useful.

343
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,020
And actually, this
technique is used

344
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,400
in Bitcoin and all
different cryptocurrencies,

345
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,220
where you can call
this a pubkey hash--

346
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,300
pubkey hash, or they say PKH.

347
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,562
And the main benefit
is size, right?

348
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:25,770
You could say, well, if I've
got a really big pubkey,

349
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,040
I can commit to it by sending
to the hash of the pubkey.

350
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,230
And then, when I
later want to sign,

351
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,780
I reveal the actual pubkey.

352
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,020
You can do it that way.

353
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,520
OK.

354
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,370
So then this is
pretty cool, right?

355
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,840
We've now taken our system,
which had fairly large--

356
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,660
16 kilobyte-- private
keys, turned them

357
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,010
into 32 byte private keys.

358
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,610
Great.

359
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,970
And also, this is 0
of 1-- never expands.

360
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,050
Awesome.

361
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,680
We've taken a system with
large, potentially huge--

362
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,130
32 kilobyte, 64
kilobyte-- public keys.

363
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,080
We've got it down to 32 bytes.

364
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,630
Awesome.

365
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,130
OK.

366
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,579
We've now made this thing
much more efficient, much more

367
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,450
useful.

368
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,880
The problem-- the
signatures are still big.

369
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,250
They actually got
a little bit bigger

370
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,490
because they include the full
public key in the signature.

371
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,940
And let's say we had
one of these things,

372
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,190
where we make a
bunch of public keys

373
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,109
and commit to them
at the outset.

374
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:25,890
So you say, OK, I've got
a 64 kilobyte pubkey.

375
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,410
I can commit to the whole
thing by hashing it.

376
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:32,460
However, then, when I reveal and
want to give you a signature,

377
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,050
my signature is now
whatever it'll be--

378
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,600
72, right?

379
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,820
The signature would
be 72 kilobytes--

380
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,090
kind of huge.

381
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,570
So I can add a bunch
of keys, but I'm just

382
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,700
sort of pushing the
problem somewhere else--

383
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,680
into the signature, right?

384
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,920
There's a better way to
commit to many public keys.

385
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,820
It's maybe not super obvious
unless you've seen it before.

386
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,990
But if you have,
do you know what

387
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,682
the better way to commit
to many public keys is?

388
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:07,390
Or you could come up
with it on the spot,

389
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,265
and it'd be like, wow,
you should have gotten

390
00:18:09,265 --> 00:18:12,610
this stuff named after you.

391
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,730
Any idea?

392
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,010
OK.

393
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,140
So what you can do--

394
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,000
it's a little non-obvious--

395
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,100
you can make a tree, right?

396
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,860
So the idea is instead
of just saying,

397
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,090
oh, I'm going to take all
four of my big pubkeys,

398
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,240
stick them all in a row, take
the hash of that whole thing

399
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,610
and publish that
as my public hash,

400
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,790
I'm going to have a little
bit more complex design.

401
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,860
And that design
is a binary tree.

402
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,690
OK.

403
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,220
So the idea is here are my four
public keys that take up 64K

404
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,510
each.

405
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,550
I can make these
intermediate hashes.

406
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,310
So I make a binary tree
where I say, OK, this

407
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:56,570
is the hash of the first
two keys stuck together.

408
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,820
This is the hash of the second
two keys stuck together.

409
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,420
The top is the hash of these
two intermediate hashes

410
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,790
stuck together.

411
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,510
And then, this top
is my root, which is

412
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,760
equivalent to my pubkey hash.

413
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,440
And so I can publish this,
and it commits me to all four

414
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,020
of my public keys.

415
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,580
So it might not be obvious.

416
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,410
Do you see any
advantages that this

417
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,530
could have over just
concatenating all four

418
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,730
of the keys and hashing it?

419
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,040
Yes?

420
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,998
AUDIENCE: I'm confused.

421
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:33,970
Where is your
private key in this?

422
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,620
TADGE DRYJA: The private
key is down here, right?

423
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,060
The private key is not shown.

424
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,820
But I have a private key.

425
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,123
It turns into these pubkeys.

426
00:19:42,123 --> 00:19:43,540
And we can use the
technique here,

427
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,650
where we just have, really,
one 32 byte private key

428
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,310
and create all the different
chunks of all the public keys

429
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,100
by concatenating
different indices.

430
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,600
Yes?

431
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,880
AUDIENCE: You can do [INAUDIBLE]
systems and log-in time instead

432
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,120
of linear time.

433
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,710
TADGE DRYJA: Yeah, exactly.

434
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,880
I can prove that, hey,
this is public key 0, which

435
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,910
is in here, this root hash, and
I don't have to reveal all four

436
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,130
in order to do it.

437
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,370
So yeah.

438
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,640
Did someone else have,
probably, the same idea?

439
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,500
Yeah, OK.

440
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,000
OK.

441
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,610
So how are we going to do that?

442
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,070
You obviously know.

443
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,670
Anyone else?

444
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,820
Yeah.

445
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,440
AUDIENCE: So assuming you
wanted the public key 0,

446
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,680
you would publish that and
1, and also hash of 2, 3.

447
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,150
TADGE DRYJA: Right, yeah.

448
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,800
And then you can
prove up to the top.

449
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,230
So I have little colors.

450
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:43,740
So the idea is the verifier
who's verifying the signature,

451
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,680
he already knows
the root, right?

452
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,130
Because you've pre-published
that as your public key,

453
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,450
as your public key root
and your public key hash.

454
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,300
And then that
verifier is provided

455
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,390
with public key 0 saying,
hey, here's a signature.

456
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,510
Here's the message.

457
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,870
Here is public key 0.

458
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,460
So you've got both
of these things.

459
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,650
Now, the prover needs to
prove that public key 0 is

460
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,870
contained within the root.

461
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,860
And to do that, the only two
things the prover needs to add

462
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,380
is pub1--

463
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,510
OK, so the prover says,
here's public key 1.

464
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,770
That allows the verifier
to compute this.

465
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,510
And then the prover
says, hey, here's

466
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:32,190
hash 2, 3, which allows the
verifier to compute the root

467
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,800
and then check that it's equal.

468
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,300
So yeah, you only need two extra
hashes instead of all four.

469
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,127
So saves some space.

470
00:21:39,127 --> 00:21:41,460
It doesn't save that much
space when you only have four.

471
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,540
It saves a lot of space
when you have 1,000, right?

472
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,050
So you can add 0 of n elements.

473
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,330
And the root stays
the same size.

474
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,190
The root stays 32
bytes, regardless

475
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,000
of how many leaf nodes you have.

476
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,110
And you can prove an
element with log n--

477
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,176
oh, those parentheses
are wrong--

478
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:02,340
0 log n intermediate hashes.

479
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,510
So if you have 1,000 keys,
your root stays 32 bytes,

480
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:10,830
and your proofs are going to
be not too, too big, right--

481
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,000
320 bytes of overhead,
which is a bunch smaller

482
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,550
than a signature, right?

483
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,580
So this is really cool.

484
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,450
And you can use this
much more practically

485
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,150
than the raw lamport
signatures that

486
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,680
were in the first problem set.

487
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,760
Because those, if
you're just doing

488
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,640
one key and one signature,
it's about the same size.

489
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,920
But this actually lets
you use it multiple times,

490
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,230
lets you store a much
smaller private key,

491
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,180
commit to much
smaller public keys.

492
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,740
It's a more usable system.

493
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:46,072
The signatures, though, still
are kind of huge, right?

494
00:22:46,072 --> 00:22:48,030
Your signatures are going
to be a little over 8

495
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,620
kilobytes, which is OK, right?

496
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,690
Computers can deal
with 8 kilobytes.

497
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,230
That's called a Merkle
tree made by Ralph Merkle

498
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,680
in '76 or something.

499
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,820
And it was originally made
for exactly that purpose.

500
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,900
Anyway, so these are
called Merkle trees.

501
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,120
Ralph Merkle.

502
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,025
He doesn't really
work on crypto now.

503
00:23:09,025 --> 00:23:11,590
He works on biotech
stuff now, I think.

504
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,456
Anyway.

505
00:23:12,456 --> 00:23:14,013
But he's cool.

506
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:15,930
And he gets, like,
everything named after him.

507
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,190
So you will see the
word Merkle everywhere.

508
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,160
And it's, you know, he
invented something cool.

509
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,873
Awesome.

510
00:23:21,873 --> 00:23:23,290
This is one of the
kind of things,

511
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,490
though, where it
seems like, yeah,

512
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,950
I might have been able
to think of that, right?

513
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,270
It's sort of a binary
tree and hash functions.

514
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,560
It's nothing that crazy.

515
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,710
But so there's all
sorts of Merkle trees.

516
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,440
You can make a different thing.

517
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,330
It's used in Bitcoin.

518
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,520
It's used in a bunch of
different cryptocurrencies.

519
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,750
Oh, cool.

520
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:46,060
It's a very powerful way
to take a whole bunch

521
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,770
of different things and commit
to them in one small thing.

522
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,270
OK.

523
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,530
So this is very cool.

524
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,360
But we can do better.

525
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,820
And so the next things are
things that I definitely

526
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,180
would never have thought
of because it's much more

527
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,400
complex than just, like,
hey, let's use a binary tree

528
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,530
with hashes.

529
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:05,260
And I will mention
RSA and then go

530
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:10,510
into ECDSA and elliptic curve
[INAUDIBLE] signatures, which

531
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:15,012
do different things and are not
based on just hash functions.

532
00:24:15,012 --> 00:24:16,720
So I'll talk about
RSA for a few minutes,

533
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,067
and then we'll have a little
break, like intermission.

534
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:20,900
And then we'll go into
elliptic curve stuff.

535
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,400
OK.

536
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,260
So RSA was invented by locals.

537
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,790
The R is Ron--

538
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,290
no, I think the R
stands for Rivest,

539
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,870
but Ron Rivest is at
CSAIL, and he's still

540
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,230
working on cool crypto stuff.

541
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,960
It's not used in Bitcoin
or any currency, actually--

542
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,560
well, any currently
operating cryptocurrency.

543
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,880
Because the signatures
and keys are

544
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,550
a bit larger than the
later systems we'll see--

545
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:50,500
smaller than the hash-based
things, but still a bit larger.

546
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,420
Was used in chaumian
blinded cash.

547
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,070
Because you can do blinded
signatures, where you say,

548
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,272
OK, I'm going to have you
sign something for me,

549
00:24:58,272 --> 00:24:59,980
and then after you
give me the signature,

550
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:04,000
I can pull apart the signature.

551
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,650
Because I'll have
you sign something

552
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,870
that you don't know what
you're signing, right?

553
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,630
I'm going to mask this
message and blind it

554
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,550
so that you sign the
message, and then I

555
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,310
can get your signature
on the real message

556
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,080
without you knowing
what you signed.

557
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,540
So basically, the idea
is, well, I actually

558
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:26,230
have message prime equals
message plus randomness.

559
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,210
And I say, hey, can
you sign m prime?

560
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:28,990
And you say, OK.

561
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:33,970
I produce a signature on m
prime with my private key.

562
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,370
And we'll call that s prime.

563
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:41,420
And then what I can do
is I can s equals s prime

564
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,050
minus the randomness,
or, really, some function

565
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,520
of that randomness.

566
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,240
And now I have a signature.

567
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,530
And this is a valid
signature on m.

568
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:52,760
So that's kind of cool.

569
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,802
It's like, hey, can you
sign this message for me?

570
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:57,670
And we're not going to tell
you what you're signing.

571
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,420
It seems sort of
useless, like why would I

572
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,430
sign something I have no
idea what I'm signing?

573
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,180
But it can be used in that
chaumian blinded cash.

574
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,150
Because I then have a proof
that, well, this bank didn't

575
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,550
know what they were signing,
but they signed this,

576
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:13,550
and this is their signature,
and they gave it to me.

577
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,090
And I can use that as a
thing to represent money.

578
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,340
There's all sorts of cool
things you can do with this.

579
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:24,890
The basic setup of RSA is make
two prime numbers, p and q.

580
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,880
And then compute n, which
is the product p times q.

581
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,400
So this seems fairly
straightforward, right?

582
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,660
It's not too hard.

583
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,583
Everyone knows what
prime numbers are.

584
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:36,500
Now you have this composite
number, p times q.

585
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,040
How do I make a leading
question for the next slide?

586
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,532
Does this have any relation to
things that we've looked at?

587
00:26:46,532 --> 00:26:48,740
This doesn't look at all
like a hash function, right?

588
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,080
But are there any properties
similar to a hash function

589
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,580
here?

590
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,995
Yeah?

591
00:26:55,995 --> 00:26:57,620
AUDIENCE: It's hard
to route the image.

592
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,860
It's hard to [INAUDIBLE].

593
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,700
TADGE DRYJA: Yeah.

594
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,570
It's a one-way function
in that if I know p and q,

595
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,610
I can compute n, right?

596
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:08,810
But given n, I can't
necessarily find p and q, right?

597
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,760
If they're small,
sure, I just check.

598
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,150
And there's all sorts of
algorithms to find factors.

599
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,020
But if p and q are pretty big,
like hundreds of bits long

600
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,690
or thousands of
bits long, finding n

601
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:24,380
may be impractical, whereas
if p and q are really long,

602
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,170
finding the product of both of
them will be very practical.

603
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:31,950
Even if huge, multiplying
two integers is really easy.

604
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,880
So this is a one-way function
but not a hash function.

605
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,540
And so a lot of these signature
systems use one-way functions,

606
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,810
but trickier one-way functions
that aren't hash functions,

607
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:45,810
and still have cool
things that you can do.

608
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,760
So I'm not going to go
into RSA in super detail.

609
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,917
I'm going to run
through it really quick,

610
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:53,750
and you'll be like,
huh, how does that work?

611
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,230
But if you think it's
interesting, you can look it up

612
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,980
and then maybe you go
to CSAIL and ask Ron

613
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,350
how it works, although maybe
try to look it up first.

614
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,100
He's probably explained
it a lot of times.

615
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,600
But it has different properties.

616
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,050
So you could say, I'm
going to use this p times

617
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,440
q equals n as a hash function
and make a lamport signature

618
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,850
out of it where my private key
is a whole bunch of p and q

619
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:20,000
pairs, and my public key is
a whole bunch of n's, and I

620
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,590
reveal them and stuff.

621
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,460
You could do that.

622
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,350
That would work.

623
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,240
But you can do much
more powerful things

624
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,360
because of the mathematical
properties of these things.

625
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,590
So yeah, I'm just going to
go through it really fast.

626
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:35,480
But if you know anything,
this is kind of cool.

627
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,730
The idea is you can do a
bunch of multiplication

628
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,580
and exponential modulo n.

629
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,810
And so because n
is almost prime,

630
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,640
there's some
interesting properties,

631
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,180
where if you know
the factors of n,

632
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,965
you have these
shortcuts you can do.

633
00:28:54,965 --> 00:28:56,840
And someone who doesn't
know the factors of n

634
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,290
can't do these shortcuts.

635
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:02,090
So you publish e, which is
a constant-- this is sort

636
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,490
of a parameter system.

637
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,560
So RSA is used today
all over the place.

638
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,780
If your computer
is open and you've

639
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,670
been using the web in
the last five seconds,

640
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:14,030
your computer has
performed RSA calculations.

641
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:18,380
Every time you connect to a
website, you're doing RSA.

642
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,202
So generally, it's 65537.

643
00:29:21,202 --> 00:29:22,160
They just make this up.

644
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,800
You could also use
three-- some small number.

645
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,670
And then d is a number
that you can compute

646
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,530
if you know what p and q are.

647
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:34,040
So this is sort of the
private key, right?

648
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,740
p and q itself can be
seen as the private key.

649
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,080
But you can actually
compute this d number

650
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,100
and then discard p and q.

651
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,320
And so this is how you
compute d or whatever.

652
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,490
But the idea is n is your public
key, and d is your private key.

653
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,430
e is always the same, and p and
q, you can discard afterwards.

654
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,740
And then what you can do--

655
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,020
and not going to get into
it-- but you can say, OK,

656
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,590
my signature s is
message, right--

657
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,065
I can take the hash
and make a message m--

658
00:30:03,065 --> 00:30:06,830
message to the d power modulo n.

659
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,940
And if I verify, if I take that
signature to the e power modulo

660
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,040
n, it should equal
m again, which

661
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,760
is crazy and kind of awesome.

662
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,530
Because the idea
is to sign, OK, I

663
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,660
just raised to
the d power mod n.

664
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,620
It's going to be some number
on the same size as n, right?

665
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,230
And then I give that to someone.

666
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:32,750
They take that signature
to the 65537 power modulo

667
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,480
m again and see if m--

668
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,800
the message-- comes back out.

669
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,260
And if it does,
they know I signed,

670
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,580
and I have the private
key that corresponds to n.

671
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,240
Now, the cool thing is I can
use this any number of times.

672
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,630
I can use the same
thing a bazillion times

673
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:54,890
with different m's, and
that doesn't give any help

674
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,520
on how to factor n
or how to compute d.

675
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:04,320
So this was late 70s, also,
RSA, and one of the first,

676
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,430
hey, we can do better
than hash functions.

677
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:11,060
It was developed at
around the same time

678
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,800
as hash-based signatures.

679
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,830
All of these things were sort
of coming out at the same time.

680
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,650
You can do lots of cool
stuff because there's

681
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:25,100
these properties where we
can make m prime plus m

682
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,070
and take the exponentiation of
all that, and it still works.

683
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,570
OK.

684
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,487
So that's really cool.

685
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:32,360
You can do lots of cool stuff.

686
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,440
But this is also
not used in Bitcoin.

687
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,940
One of the things is the size.

688
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,800
So key sizes are smaller
than with lamport signatures.

689
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,277
And they're often about
2 kilobits, or 256 bytes,

690
00:31:48,277 --> 00:31:48,860
which is fine.

691
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,900
And that's the same
size as signatures.

692
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,435
So if you use your web browser--

693
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,720
secure-- well, how secure?

694
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,950
Certificate, valid.

695
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,700
Oh, this browser
might not show me.

696
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,263
OK, never mind.

697
00:32:05,263 --> 00:32:06,680
AUDIENCE: In
Firefox, it'll do it.

698
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,970
TADGE DRYJA: In Firefox,
it tells you more.

699
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:09,470
OK.

700
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,030
Well, anyway, anyway, anyway.

701
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:16,250
But yeah, there's RSA keys in,
basically, every certificate

702
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,020
for web browsers and websites.

703
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,060
And they're generally
2,048 bits long.

704
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,840
That's seen as pretty secure.

705
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,500
Even 1,024 bits has
not been hacked.

706
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,000
But people think
it probably could

707
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,720
be by a very motivated actor.

708
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,550
So this is decent size.

709
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,133
One thing about RSA is that it's
a little tricky to implement,

710
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:37,633
right?

711
00:32:37,633 --> 00:32:39,440
There's a whole bunch
of weird math there.

712
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,540
It's not like the
lamport signatures,

713
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,410
where it's like, OK, I have a
hash function, use it, right?

714
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,920
It's kind of hard
to shoot yourself

715
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,070
in the foot with the
lamport signature scheme.

716
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,960
You can, right, but
it's sort of obvious

717
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,280
if you do, so if you're
doing the homework

718
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,322
and it just doesn't work
at all, and you're like,

719
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:57,680
oh, I was hashing twice, or,
oh, I was reversing the order,

720
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,300
or it just didn't work.

721
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,150
But there's no subtle ways
where, oh, I was off by one,

722
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,190
and now it reveals
all my private keys.

723
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:11,270
That's hard to do, whereas in
RSA, it's actually quite easy.

724
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,090
If your p and q
values, for example--

725
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,520
what's a really crazy gotcha--

726
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,410
if p or q minus 1-- so if
p minus 1 or q minus 1--

727
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,320
is smooth-- essentially, a
number that's highly composite

728
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,330
has many small factors--

729
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,460
you can find
someone's private key.

730
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,590
You can factor it.

731
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,850
So it's not just that p
and q have to be prime.

732
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:37,700
P minus 1 and q minus 1
have to be not too unprime.

733
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,878
It can't be a power
of two or something.

734
00:33:39,878 --> 00:33:41,420
Otherwise, you can
lose your privacy.

735
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:46,700
So there's all sorts of crazy
things that happen with RSA.

736
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,640
Bitcoin and other coins use
elliptic curve signatures,

737
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:55,760
which I'll talk about next,
that are sort of displacing RSA,

738
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,700
in many cases.

739
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:04,370
So it hasn't really taken
off for web certificates

740
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,220
but a lot of other types of
encryption, signing, things

741
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:07,760
like that.

742
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,150
Cryptocurrencies are also one of
the big uses of elliptic curve

743
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,730
signatures because
they're somewhat more

744
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,670
powerful and somewhat
smaller and really cool.

745
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:20,090
And we will talk about
those in three minutes.

746
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,699
So intermission, three minutes.

747
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,650
Stretch.

748
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,949
Ask random questions.

749
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,540
Talk to the neighbors.

750
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,040
OK.

751
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,659
So they're using
these elliptic curves,

752
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:34,790
which are curves of
the form y squared

753
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:38,150
plus x cubed plus some
coefficient x squared

754
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,239
plus some constant.

755
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,670
And in the case of
Bitcoin, it's very simple.

756
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,960
It's y squared equals
x cubed plus 7.

757
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,340
And that's the
curve Bitcoin uses.

758
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,300
And this is what it looks
like if you plot it.

759
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,920
And that seems really simple.

760
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,239
We can totally understand that.

761
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,220
But it gets a little weird.

762
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,330
With elliptic curves, you have
these points on the curves,

763
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:02,870
right?

764
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:06,530
And another property is if
you draw a straight line that

765
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,463
intersects this curve--

766
00:35:08,463 --> 00:35:10,130
you could also draw
a line which doesn't

767
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,218
intersect at all, fine--

768
00:35:11,218 --> 00:35:13,260
but if you draw a line
that intersects the curve,

769
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,575
it will intersect
in three places.

770
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:18,950
So if I draw a line here, it
intersects these three dots.

771
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,560
If I draw a line here,
it intersects here, here,

772
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,520
and then it'll intersect
somewhere down here.

773
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,690
It'll intersect in three
places unless I take a tangent.

774
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,430
If I draw, and I try
to be like, oh, I'm

775
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,230
going only intersect
in two, well, I

776
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,480
can take a tangent
here, and it'll

777
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,160
intersect in one more place.

778
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,430
What we can do, though,
is we can say, well,

779
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,180
if you intersect at a
tangent, that's kind

780
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,893
of like intersecting twice.

781
00:35:40,893 --> 00:35:41,810
We can deal with that.

782
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,637
AUDIENCE: What if you
draw a vertical line?

783
00:35:43,637 --> 00:35:45,970
TADGE DRYJA: If you draw a
vertical-- oh, yeah, vertical

784
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,710
line, then there's
a point at infinity,

785
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,498
which shouldn't happen.

786
00:35:49,498 --> 00:35:51,070
AUDIENCE: But
infinity is included--

787
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:51,385
TADGE DRYJA: Yeah.

788
00:35:51,385 --> 00:35:53,380
AUDIENCE: --in the set
of points on the curve?

789
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,130
So it's like there's
three points, anyway.

790
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,290
TADGE DRYJA: Yeah.

791
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,950
There's a point up there--

792
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,450
sort of.

793
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,920
In the practice of
signing and stuff,

794
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,910
you probably shouldn't hit it.

795
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:08,290
Yeah.

796
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:12,310
But so what we do is we say,
OK, well, three points in a line

797
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,630
equals zero.

798
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,590
And so if we take this
point plus this point

799
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,570
plus this point, that's zero.

800
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:25,550
Another way to say that is
P plus Q minus R equals 0,

801
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:30,500
or P plus Q equals negative
R. And another property is

802
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,790
the negation of a point
is just that same point

803
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,160
with the y-coordinate flipped.

804
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,160
So if this is
negative R, we just

805
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,380
go down to the
bottom side of this,

806
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,857
and this is positive
R. Similarly, minus P

807
00:36:44,857 --> 00:36:45,440
would be here.

808
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,000
Minus Q would be here.

809
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,830
And if you had a point Z here,
negative Z would be up here.

810
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,570
This is how it's constructed.

811
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:58,460
However, we don't actually
use these nice curves.

812
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,778
We chop them up in
modulo something.

813
00:37:00,778 --> 00:37:01,278
Yeah?

814
00:37:01,278 --> 00:37:03,680
AUDIENCE: You have P plus Q
equals negative R. Should it

815
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,509
be positive R?

816
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,420
TADGE DRYJA: No.

817
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,590
In this case, R is up here.

818
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,360
Right.

819
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,920
In this case--

820
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,470
P. Wait, hold on.

821
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,352
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

822
00:37:18,352 --> 00:37:19,310
TADGE DRYJA: Oh, shoot.

823
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:19,810
Sorry.

824
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,790
P plus Q equals R. Right.

825
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,840
Sorry.

826
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,340
OK.

827
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,140
Never mind.

828
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,180
Yeah.

829
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,490
The picture is correct.

830
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:35,002
But so basically,
P plus Q equals R

831
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:35,960
because R is down here.

832
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,460
Sorry.

833
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,600
Yeah, that's why.

834
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,120
OK.

835
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,550
This is R. This is
negative R. So yeah,

836
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:47,720
P plus Q equals R,
not negative R. Sorry.

837
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,750
When you want to multiply
a point, you can.

838
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,712
Because you can take
a tangent, right?

839
00:37:52,712 --> 00:37:54,170
So you can add
these points, right?

840
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:57,050
You can say, OK, I want
the sum of P and Q,

841
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,500
which will be down here--

842
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,320
R. I want 2P, for example.

843
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,870
Well, with 2P, I
can take a tangent

844
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,460
and then find
where it intersects

845
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,450
and then go down
below the curve.

846
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:13,100
So for example, if this
is G, I say OK, well, G

847
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,400
starts here, take the tangent,
find where it intersects

848
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,840
and then drop down.

849
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,850
And this is 2G.

850
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,865
So it's a simple
way to say, well,

851
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:23,990
I'm not really multiplying.

852
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,760
I'm just adding it
to itself, which is

853
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,613
sort of what multiplication is.

854
00:38:27,613 --> 00:38:29,030
And I can do this
again and again.

855
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,620
So I say, oh, I want 4G.

856
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,700
I take the tangent at 2G,
find the intersection here,

857
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,370
drop down.

858
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:34,870
OK.

859
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,840
Here's 4G.

860
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,030
Take the tangent
here, it'll go--

861
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:41,630
I can keep doing that
and get 2G, 4G, 8G.

862
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:46,460
And if I want intermediate
things, like, well, I want 3G,

863
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:51,670
well, I draw a line between G
and 2G, find the intersection,

864
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,150
and find the sum.

865
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:53,990
So yeah?

866
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,490
Yes?

867
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,370
AUDIENCE: When you find
the intersection of that

868
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,703
[INAUDIBLE] the intersection
of the modulo of something,

869
00:38:59,703 --> 00:39:00,240
does it just--

870
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
TADGE DRYJA: Yeah, yeah.

871
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,162
So the pictures look
nice, in this case, right?

872
00:39:05,162 --> 00:39:06,620
It's like, hey,
there's this curve.

873
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,490
And it looks so simple.

874
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,970
And we can graphically
do it on graph paper.

875
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,280
But when you're actually
doing it on the computer,

876
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,960
it looks more like this.

877
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,890
Everything is modulo
some giant prime number.

878
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,300
You could still draw lines.

879
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:24,560
It's just that the curve is now
all these crazy-looking dots.

880
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,850
And you still have that
symmetry from the y-axis.

881
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:32,060
But the way the computer does
it is all modulo a number.

882
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:37,770
So it doesn't actually
map to a nice curve.

883
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:40,370
So the fun thing about
when you're doing modulo

884
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,892
is all the properties
stay the same, right?

885
00:39:43,892 --> 00:39:45,350
With regular numbers,
you can still

886
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,660
do addition,
multiplication, division

887
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,500
all modulo some number, and
it still all works, right?

888
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,600
So same with this.

889
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,800
You still have the same
draw a line between P and Q,

890
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,780
and you get to here.

891
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:05,240
And then you flip over the
y-axis, and now this is R.

892
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,670
Similarly, you can
take a tangent--

893
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,610
although a tangent is harder
to visually see because there's

894
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,950
no obvious curve here--

895
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,100
but the equations work the same.

896
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,600
OK.

897
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,860
So you don't need to know
exactly why these things work

898
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,360
or curves.

899
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,540
But we're going to go through
what you can do with these

900
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,820
and what properties you have.

901
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,320
OK.

902
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,480
So we've defined these
points on a curve

903
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,860
and how this curve works.

904
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:35,520
And then we also have
regular old numbers, right?

905
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,520
So what we'll do from now
on is say, like a and b,

906
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,760
our lowercase numbers,
these are scalars.

907
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,880
Scalars just means
regular old numbers.

908
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,310
The uppercase A and B will refer
to points on the curve, OK?

909
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,080
So from now on, lowercase
is regular number,

910
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,150
uppercase is point
on this curve,

911
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:58,678
or point on this mashed-up thing
that we still call a curve.

912
00:40:58,678 --> 00:40:59,510
OK.

913
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,700
So I'll go through what
operations we can do,

914
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,090
and then we can see
what use those have.

915
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,190
So first, scalars.

916
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,990
You can add, subtract,
multiply, divide.

917
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,490
You can do whatever
you want, right?

918
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:14,860
These are just regular
numbers, like five or 17 or 22.

919
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,090
Everything's OK, right?

920
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:17,780
Easy.

921
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,947
Everything here is integers.

922
00:41:18,947 --> 00:41:21,530
We're doing modulo
some big prime number,

923
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,598
so there's no decimal points.

924
00:41:24,598 --> 00:41:26,390
I think in this class,
we'll probably never

925
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:28,700
have to use floating
point, which is great,

926
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,360
because floating point
always scares me.

927
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,710
It's also uint.

928
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,177
These are like
unsigned integers.

929
00:41:35,177 --> 00:41:36,260
You can do it with signed.

930
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,470
But since you're
modulo some big number,

931
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:42,380
it's like unsigned
numbers that loop around.

932
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,910
So it's really
nice for computers.

933
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,410
Computers deal very
well with these things.

934
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:47,030
Computers are good at
floating point, as well.

935
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,680
But the thing is,
in cryptography,

936
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,520
a lot of times floating point
ends up with error, right,

937
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,950
where you're pretty
close, but you've

938
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,670
got some fixed amount of
decimal places you can store.

939
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:01,010
Your floating point goes
out to some precision.

940
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,480
And then error can accumulate.

941
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,470
And in a lot of cryptography,
you want zero error, right?

942
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:09,500
Like in a hash function,
it's pretty exact.

943
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,140
So a lot of times,
the cryptography,

944
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,960
you use integers instead of
floating point or rational

945
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,110
numbers.

946
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:16,610
OK.

947
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:20,600
So with scalars, these
are just regular integers,

948
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,520
natural numbers even.

949
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,480
You can do these.

950
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,940
All the operations,
you're familiar with.

951
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,070
That's fairly straightforward.

952
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,300
With points.

953
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,960
So you can add and
subtract the points, right?

954
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,020
We showed how you
do that visually.

955
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,030
And then the equations
for it, the computer

956
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,810
can do that pretty quick.

957
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,630
However, this is not defined.

958
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:46,320
Multiplication and division
with two points is undefined.

959
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,042
It's just not clear
how you do it.

960
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:50,750
It's not something in
this system, right?

961
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,400
It's a group.

962
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,210
You've got one operation.

963
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,052
You don't have this other one.

964
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:56,510
So you can add and
subtract points,

965
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,430
but you can't multiply them.

966
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,820
Any questions about this?

967
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,010
This is pretty important.

968
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:03,990
Make sense?

969
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,490
Yes?

970
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:08,100
AUDIENCE: In the previous case,
when you were adding points,

971
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,380
what is defined as addition?

972
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,630
Are you adding only
the y components?

973
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,840
TADGE DRYJA: You use both
the x and y-coordinates

974
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,720
to add, right?

975
00:43:18,093 --> 00:43:19,760
So when you're doing
it in the computer,

976
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,135
you're saying,
OK, well, what are

977
00:43:21,135 --> 00:43:22,665
the x- and y-coordinates of P?

978
00:43:22,665 --> 00:43:24,290
What are the x- and
y-coordinates of Q?

979
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,440
Find the slope here and
where it intersects the axis.

980
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,560
And then see where it'll
intersect the curve

981
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,615
at another point.

982
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:38,290
AUDIENCE: Addition Is literally
defined as compute that point.

983
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:41,400
It is not a function of adding
the x- and y-coordinates.

984
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,230
AUDIENCE: Gotcha.

985
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:42,980
TADGE DRYJA: Yeah.

986
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,380
Well, I mean-- yeah.

987
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,900
But the equation would be--

988
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,150
since the computer doesn't
actually look at the curve,

989
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,140
you just say, OK.

990
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,700
Find the Px- and y-coordinate.

991
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,200
Find the Qx- and y-coordinate.

992
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,410
Find the slope, and then
find where it intersects,

993
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:03,800
and then compute for that for R.

994
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,300
OK.

995
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,770
So yeah.

996
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:06,970
You can add and subtract.

997
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:09,760
You cannot multiply and
divide these points.

998
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,420
Sounds good?

999
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,670
Any other questions?

1000
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:12,325
Yes?

1001
00:44:12,325 --> 00:44:13,700
AUDIENCE: How
would you subtract?

1002
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,990
TADGE DRYJA: Ah.

1003
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:18,920
You just go down, right?

1004
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,880
So if I want P minus Q, I
should say P plus negative Q.

1005
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,030
And negative Q is just right
here, right down on the axis.

1006
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,980
So I say, OK, I want
P minus Q. I go here.

1007
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:28,730
Find it.

1008
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:31,920
It's going to be
up there somewhere.

1009
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,420
So yeah.

1010
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:37,050
You just add the
negative of the number.

1011
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:40,470
I guess that's another thing.

1012
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,320
Minus B-- negative B-- is
also an operation I can do.

1013
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,608
I can negate something,
which lets me do subtraction.

1014
00:44:47,608 --> 00:44:49,650
AUDIENCE: For those of
you with math backgrounds,

1015
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,530
this is defining
a group operation

1016
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:54,337
on the field of natural
numbers, modulo--

1017
00:44:54,337 --> 00:44:55,670
TADGE DRYJA: Which is a big one.

1018
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:56,950
AUDIENCE: --and using
this elliptic curve.

1019
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:59,340
So this is A. And the
only thing that's defined

1020
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,640
is addition and subtraction
and not multiplication.

1021
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,090
TADGE DRYJA: Right.

1022
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,920
You can do the same
group operations

1023
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,420
without using elliptic curves.

1024
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,910
And so you can just
do exponential modulo

1025
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:10,440
big prime number.

1026
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,940
I'm going to use
curves because it's

1027
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,600
what is used in all
the actual systems.

1028
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,380
But you can sort of forget about
the curve after this, right?

1029
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:25,140
You can say, well, look, we just
have these uppercase variables

1030
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,460
and these lowercase variables.

1031
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,070
And the fact that it's on a
curve, we can sort of abstract

1032
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:31,650
away and just know that we
have these different types,

1033
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:32,460
essentially.

1034
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,110
And when you're in the
computer, you're just like,

1035
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,100
yeah, that's a point.

1036
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:35,970
That's a scalar.

1037
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:37,670
Here are the
operations I can do,

1038
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,820
and I just run the functions.

1039
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,320
OK.

1040
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:46,080
So the next part, when you
mix scalars and points,

1041
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,000
so mixed operations.

1042
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,480
You cannot add a point and an
integer or subtract a point

1043
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,380
and an integer.

1044
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,490
That's not defined, right?

1045
00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:00,300
You say, OK, here's
this point p minus 7.

1046
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,130
Well, does that mean
move the x-axis?

1047
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,840
Does that mean move the y?

1048
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,320
It's not defined.

1049
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,410
However, you can do this, right?

1050
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:10,020
You can multiply and divide.

1051
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,530
So you can say, well,
A times 2, well,

1052
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,700
you take the tangent, right?

1053
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,080
It's just A plus A. Or A times
7, is we just break it down as

1054
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,720
A plus A plus A plus A 17 times.

1055
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,580
We can also divide,
which is a little weird

1056
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,600
because we have to
find the inverse of B

1057
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,640
and then multiply by that--

1058
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,825
the multiplicative inverse
of B modulo the order.

1059
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:35,958
But anyway, you can do these.

1060
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:37,500
This is a little
trickier because you

1061
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,810
have to compute what, like,
B to the negative 1 is

1062
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:40,920
and multiply by that.

1063
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:41,760
You can do it.

1064
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,468
So you can do these things where
you have points times scalars.

1065
00:46:45,468 --> 00:46:46,260
But you cannot add.

1066
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:46,440
Yeah?

1067
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,110
AUDIENCE: So 2A is
basically joining

1068
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:50,480
the tangent to A,
[INAUDIBLE] beginning.

1069
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,300
TADGE DRYJA: Yep.

1070
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,060
So that was here.

1071
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,800
If this is G, this is 2G.

1072
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:00,140
Find the tangent, find the
intersection, and then negate.

1073
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:00,640
OK.

1074
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,260
So you can do that.

1075
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:03,760
That's cool.

1076
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,220
You cannot do that.

1077
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:06,720
OK.

1078
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,540
So roster of
operations we can do.

1079
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,690
This is it.

1080
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:13,600
And this is sort of,
if you think of that,

1081
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,410
you can do all
these cool things.

1082
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,260
It's sort of amazing,
all the crazy things

1083
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,690
you can do with just
these operations, right?

1084
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:22,010
With regular numbers, you
can do whatever you want.

1085
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:23,380
That's obvious.

1086
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,260
And with these points, you
can add and subtract them.

1087
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,380
And when you mix, you
can multiply and divide.

1088
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,590
And that's it.

1089
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:31,090
OK.

1090
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:34,330
Any questions so far?

1091
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:37,275
You don't have to worry too
much about the curves and all

1092
00:47:37,275 --> 00:47:38,380
of the math and stuff.

1093
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:41,105
But you just sort of say,
OK, here's my toolbox.

1094
00:47:41,105 --> 00:47:41,980
Here's what I can do.

1095
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:45,450
OK.

1096
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:46,033
Any questions?

1097
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:47,370
Good?

1098
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:52,750
So now what we can do is we
can define a one-way function

1099
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,990
sort of like a hash function,
sort of like multiplying

1100
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,260
p times q to get n.

1101
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,390
What we will need,
in addition to this,

1102
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:05,170
is everyone pick some point on
the curve, and we call it G.

1103
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:06,130
And it's random.

1104
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,770
And we want it to be
somewhat verifiably random.

1105
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:12,220
We just all have to
agree on a point.

1106
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:15,760
And we'll call this
the generator point.

1107
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,290
Another property is that, since
it's all modulo, this number,

1108
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:23,950
if B is too big, you'll
wrap around, right,

1109
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:26,380
because it's all modulo, this n.

1110
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,690
So it's called a
generator point because--

1111
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:30,550
and every point on
the curve can be one--

1112
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:33,790
if you keep, say,
2G, 3G, 4G, 5G,

1113
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:37,360
eventually, you'll
get back to G, right?

1114
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,840
It's all finite.

1115
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,080
OK so does anyone
have an idea, OK,

1116
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,070
how would we make some
cool one-way function

1117
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:49,960
given these operations
and the fact

1118
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,250
that we have an
agreed-upon point?

1119
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,140
It's not super obvious,
but it's actually

1120
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,850
fairly straightforward.

1121
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,302
Once you see it,
you're like, oh.

1122
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:01,530
Any ideas?

1123
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:01,710
Yeah.

1124
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,285
AUDIENCE: So you
take your point G,

1125
00:49:03,285 --> 00:49:05,935
and you multiply
it by some scalar,

1126
00:49:05,935 --> 00:49:09,550
and you publish where the
point is [INAUDIBLE] scalars.

1127
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,260
TADGE DRYJA: Yep, yep.

1128
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:11,760
OK.

1129
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,630
So your private key--

1130
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:15,720
let's say private
key, lowercase a,

1131
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,930
it's just some 256 bit
random number, scalar,

1132
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:23,490
exactly the same as 32 bytes
like in a lamport signature.

1133
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:26,340
And your public key
is just a times G.

1134
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:30,810
And your public key is
now a point on a curve.

1135
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,280
We're going to call
it uppercase A.

1136
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,340
And you have a 32 byte
x-coordinate, right--

1137
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:38,540
because the x
dimension is 256 bits--

1138
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,930
32 byte y-coordinate.

1139
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:41,250
So it's 64 bytes--

1140
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:42,150
pretty small.

1141
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:45,420
Anyone have another
quick optimization

1142
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,520
on how you could reduce this?

1143
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,430
So there's a lot of
optimization going on

1144
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:52,410
in all these different
cryptocurrency systems.

1145
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:53,827
Because they don't
scale too well.

1146
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:58,592
But any idea of how
to get that down?

1147
00:49:58,592 --> 00:50:00,232
AUDIENCE: Can you hash it?

1148
00:50:00,232 --> 00:50:01,190
TADGE DRYJA: You could.

1149
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:02,065
So you could hash it.

1150
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:05,460
You'd make it into 32 bytes.

1151
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,888
There's a more useful way.

1152
00:50:08,888 --> 00:50:11,430
But if you hash it, you still
have to reveal it later, right?

1153
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:14,190
So it helps, making
a pubkey hash.

1154
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:16,640
And that's what
Bitcoin did initially

1155
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,980
is you'd have the
64 byte public keys.

1156
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,320
And then you'd send
to the hash of them.

1157
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,500
There's a nicer way.

1158
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,470
Any ideas?

1159
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:26,970
OK.

1160
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:31,770
So the thing is it's
symmetric, right?

1161
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:36,630
So the curve is symmetric
about the x-axis.

1162
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:40,750
Any ideas?

1163
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:41,380
yes.

1164
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,880
AUDIENCE: Could you just code
one of the x- or y-coordinates

1165
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,948
and say which side?

1166
00:50:44,948 --> 00:50:45,740
TADGE DRYJA: Right.

1167
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:49,643
So you take the x-coordinate
and encode that.

1168
00:50:49,643 --> 00:50:50,810
And then just that one bit--

1169
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:51,790
4-- it's on the top.

1170
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,030
It's on the bottom.

1171
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:56,210
And then let them figure out
exactly where it is, right?

1172
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:58,760
So you can encode the
x-coordinate only and 1 bit

1173
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,370
for y, and then you're
down to 33 bytes.

1174
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,830
It's a little annoying
because the 33 bytes, well,

1175
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:06,160
one of those bytes
is going to be empty.

1176
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,780
It's just going to have one
bit in it for up or down.

1177
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,200
But whatever.

1178
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,200
So you can do that, and
that's also really cool.

1179
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,060
OK.

1180
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:17,210
Any questions so far?

1181
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:21,310
AUDIENCE: Could you encode
a [INAUDIBLE] and same

1182
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:22,252
up and down?

1183
00:51:22,252 --> 00:51:24,136
Could you just encode
an [INAUDIBLE]??

1184
00:51:24,136 --> 00:51:25,550
TADGE DRYJA: Huh.

1185
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,720
Probably.

1186
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,750
But I don't think
it would be smaller.

1187
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,910
I think you'd have to
probably have the same size

1188
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,577
if you use some other
coordinate system.

1189
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:37,790
Hm.

1190
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,907
Yeah, you could encode a slope--

1191
00:51:39,907 --> 00:51:41,240
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the [INAUDIBLE].

1192
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,865
TADGE DRYJA: And you
say it intersects,

1193
00:51:42,865 --> 00:51:44,960
and it's at the slope, and
which side of the axis?

1194
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,700
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and if it
crosses multiple times,

1195
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,450
which one of the--

1196
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:48,350
TADGE DRYJA: You probably could.

1197
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:50,170
I think you would
end up the same size.

1198
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:50,715
But yeah.

1199
00:51:50,715 --> 00:51:52,340
But it might be faster
for some things.

1200
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,710
There's all sorts of
different encodings.

1201
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:57,990
AUDIENCE: I guarantee that you
have an integer in the end.

1202
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:58,795
TADGE DRYJA: Yeah.

1203
00:51:58,795 --> 00:52:00,170
So you might not
be on the curve.

1204
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:01,640
But there's a
similar problem here

1205
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,320
where it might not
be on the curve.

1206
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,360
You can encode a point
that's also off the curve.

1207
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,930
And so when you actually
get a public key,

1208
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,515
like over the wire
in these systems,

1209
00:52:11,515 --> 00:52:12,890
the first thing
you usually do is

1210
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:14,432
make sure this is
a valid public key,

1211
00:52:14,432 --> 00:52:16,217
and it's actually on the curve.

1212
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:18,050
Because there's a lot
of points that aren't.

1213
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,690
And sometimes you can screw
around with the code that way.

1214
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:20,820
Yeah?

1215
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:23,240
AUDIENCE: Can you define the
scalar multiplication again?

1216
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,010
how does it go?

1217
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:24,677
TADGE DRYJA: OK.

1218
00:52:24,677 --> 00:52:29,120
So scalar multiplication--
a times G is, basically,

1219
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,960
break it out as G plus G
plus G plus G plus G a times.

1220
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,890
And G plus G is find
the tangent of G

1221
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,980
and then find the
intersection, right?

1222
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,870
So this is G. This is 2G,
right-- tangent, intersect,

1223
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,940
and then the negation.

1224
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,810
And so you just do
that a bazillion times.

1225
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:53,900
However, since you can
find 2G and then you

1226
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,320
can double 2G to get 4G
and double 4G to get 8G,

1227
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,140
you can come up with
powers of 2 of G

1228
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,240
and then add those
powers of 2 to do

1229
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,650
a much more efficient addition
so that you can practically

1230
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:07,570
make--

1231
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:12,890
because little a is going to
be some huge decimal 50-digit

1232
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,290
number or whatever.

1233
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:17,450
So you're going to have
to do this two, four, six,

1234
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:20,820
eight binary expansion
and then add them all up.

1235
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,220
OK.

1236
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,570
Yeah?

1237
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:29,860
AUDIENCE: You're chucking
everything into some grain size

1238
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,800
to get these.

1239
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,642
You're [INAUDIBLE]
a continuous curve.

1240
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:33,350
TADGE DRYJA: Yes.

1241
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:37,630
AUDIENCE: It feels like if you
have 306 bits in the original,

1242
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:40,810
you shouldn't be able to get all
the way down to 32 bits, right?

1243
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,830
Because you just want
to make sure that you--

1244
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:43,707
TADGE DRYJA: This?

1245
00:53:43,707 --> 00:53:44,332
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1246
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,150
If you removed a
byte of precision,

1247
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:52,640
would you actually
be losing any power?

1248
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,580
TADGE DRYJA: What you can do
a little-- what you can do

1249
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,520
is you can just
say, look, I'm only

1250
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:06,140
going to allow public keys
that are on the top, positive y

1251
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:07,070
component.

1252
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:09,545
And everything
else is disallowed.

1253
00:54:09,545 --> 00:54:11,420
You could have that as
a rule of your system,

1254
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:14,810
and then you can get
rid of the y bit.

1255
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:19,430
But the thing is
the y-coordinate

1256
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:23,103
does affect some of the
things like signatures, things

1257
00:54:23,103 --> 00:54:24,020
that you'll later use.

1258
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:28,580
So you can just say, OK, look,
implicitly y bit is positive.

1259
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:32,240
And you lose 1 bit of security.

1260
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,250
Because there is a
difference between

1261
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:37,742
the positive and negative
thing if you're doing signing.

1262
00:54:37,742 --> 00:54:38,460
But yeah.

1263
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,950
And so some systems do do that.

1264
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:42,340
And it makes things easier.

1265
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,180
There's some signing
systems that do that.

1266
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:44,680
OK.

1267
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,990
I'm going to go
to the next part.

1268
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,610
ECDSA is used in bitcoin.

1269
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:56,010
I'm actually not
going to explain it.

1270
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:58,400
It's a worse signature system.

1271
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,420
So the reason why this was
used was the better system

1272
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,490
was patented.

1273
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:11,180
And so there's a clearer, more
obvious, cleaner, more powerful

1274
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:14,240
signature system that was
patented by this German guy,

1275
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,170
Claus Schnorr.

1276
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:17,660
And so no one used it, or
maybe a few people used it.

1277
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:21,860
But in general, with open
source things and web standards,

1278
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,590
patents are really
hard to work with.

1279
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,140
And so all the
cryptographers said,

1280
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,360
well, we'll make
this other system

1281
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,540
that's different enough that it
doesn't infringe on the patent.

1282
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:36,200
And it's kind of ugly.

1283
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,720
It does work as a
signature scheme.

1284
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,760
But actually, I'm
going to explain

1285
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:46,100
the Schnorr signatures,
which make a lot more sense,

1286
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,410
are easier to understand
and manipulate,

1287
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,840
and the patent has expired,
so we can all use it.

1288
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,780
And it will probably
be going into Bitcoin.

1289
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:56,490
And some cryptocurrencies
use Schnorr signatures.

1290
00:55:56,490 --> 00:56:02,180
I think Monero uses a
Schnorr-like signature.

1291
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,480
But Bitcoin will
probably be putting it

1292
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,130
into Bitcoin in the
next year or so.

1293
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:10,220
So all these things will
be much more applicable,

1294
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:11,310
and you can use them.

1295
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:12,185
And there's code out.

1296
00:56:12,185 --> 00:56:13,620
You can use them now.

1297
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,120
OK.

1298
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,410
Yeah.

1299
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:15,008
Sorry.

1300
00:56:15,008 --> 00:56:16,800
Patent has expired--
free to use the better

1301
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,350
algo that must not be named.

1302
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:20,352
So yeah.

1303
00:56:20,352 --> 00:56:22,310
People don't call it
Schnorr signature as much.

1304
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,800
Because it's like, well, this
is the guy who prevented us

1305
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,900
from using this for 20 years.

1306
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,300
And there's modifications to it.

1307
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:31,800
OK.

1308
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:36,350
So the elliptic curve signature,
for lack of a better name.

1309
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:38,360
This is something
of a simplification.

1310
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,000
And there's reading
about how you can really

1311
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,907
do it the right way.

1312
00:56:41,907 --> 00:56:43,490
But this does give
you the right idea.

1313
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:48,170
And for a single signer,
this is secure, and it works.

1314
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:51,050
But later things, you might want
to actually add other stuff.

1315
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:54,360
So the idea is you've got
your message m, right?

1316
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,570
Same as in lamport,
same as in RSA, you've

1317
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:59,620
got a message m and a
private key lowercase a.

1318
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:03,755
And your public key is
a times G, like we said.

1319
00:57:03,755 --> 00:57:05,630
And then, when you want
to sign, you actually

1320
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:10,490
make a one-time use key
pair for the signature only.

1321
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:12,530
And they usually call that k.

1322
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:15,650
And k is a new random number.

1323
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:17,150
It's the private key.

1324
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:20,308
And you're going to
multiply it by G.

1325
00:57:20,308 --> 00:57:22,100
And they call this R.
I don't know why they

1326
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:25,460
use these letters, but anyway.

1327
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:30,680
K times G is R. R is the other
public key you're using just

1328
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,720
for this signature.

1329
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,170
And then the signature itself
is quite straightforward.

1330
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:40,590
As the signer, you
compute s, which is k--

1331
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,750
this new private key
you just made up--

1332
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:47,160
minus the hash of your
message concatenated with R,

1333
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,990
this public key-- so you encode
the public key in 33 bytes,

1334
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:50,910
stick it in there--

1335
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:55,650
multiplied by a, your
normal private key.

1336
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:57,990
And then your
signature is the pair--

1337
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:00,990
the R point and the s scalar.

1338
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:03,390
This is a little bit
of a bunch to process.

1339
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:06,150
But it's actually
not too bad, right?

1340
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,110
This is a scalar--

1341
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,490
32 bytes-- that you made up.

1342
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:14,400
The hash, this is a message,
also going to be however long.

1343
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,348
This is 33 bytes.

1344
00:58:15,348 --> 00:58:16,890
You concatenate them
together-- hash.

1345
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:20,550
You end up with
another 32 byte scalar.

1346
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:23,320
You multiply those two scalars.

1347
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,760
So actually, the only
elliptic curve operation

1348
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,160
here is calculating what R is.

1349
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,810
When you're actually
calculating s,

1350
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:33,840
this is all just scalar,
so it's very fast.

1351
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,090
So in terms of practical
computer stuff,

1352
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:39,720
doing these operations is a
little bit on the slow side.

1353
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,270
Because you're doing those
point additions quite a number

1354
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:44,160
of times.

1355
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,430
So a decent code,
a decent CPU, can

1356
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:53,100
do on the order of thousands
of these types of operations

1357
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:56,610
per second, which is decent.

1358
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:59,190
You can do a decent amount,
but it is kind of slow.

1359
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:01,770
And it's considerably
slower than hash functions.

1360
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:04,770
You can do a million iterations
of a hash function per second

1361
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,350
on a core, or you can
do, maybe, 1,000 or 2,000

1362
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:11,980
of this kind of thing, so
still pretty fast but slower.

1363
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:16,585
And so this signing procedure,
this takes a bit of time.

1364
00:59:16,585 --> 00:59:18,210
This takes, actually,
very little time.

1365
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:23,100
Because you're just subtracting
and multiplying 32 byte scalar

1366
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,810
integers, which is much faster.

1367
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:26,310
OK.

1368
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:29,300
So does this make sense?

1369
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,750
We'll go a little bit of
how you can't forge this.

1370
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:32,250
OK.

1371
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:32,750
Sorry.

1372
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:33,680
So first verification.

1373
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,280
Sorry.

1374
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:39,140
So how would you, if
anyone knows or can think,

1375
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:43,010
how would you
verify this, right?

1376
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:44,460
I know their public key--

1377
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:47,420
capital A, which is
little a times G--

1378
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,340
and then they're
giving me a message m,

1379
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:51,800
and they're giving me a
signature, which is R and s.

1380
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,900
And they've computed
it this way.

1381
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,020
I can't verify this
equation myself

1382
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:58,610
because I don't know what k is.

1383
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:00,560
I don't know what
little a is, right?

1384
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:09,470
I'm just given R, s, m, and big
A. So how would I verify this?

1385
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:13,510
AUDIENCE: Can I, for example,
take the hash of the message,

1386
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:21,124
use R, and then try
random a's and that--

1387
01:00:21,124 --> 01:00:22,250
on, sorry.

1388
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,000
TADGE DRYJA: Yeah.

1389
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,350
Do you have one?

1390
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:26,850
AUDIENCE: So trying random is
probably [INAUDIBLE] because--

1391
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:27,685
TADGE DRYJA:
There's a lot, yeah.

1392
01:00:27,685 --> 01:00:28,893
AUDIENCE: --there's too many.

1393
01:00:28,893 --> 01:00:30,550
The old one that
you don't know it.

1394
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:33,910
But I think one more thing
you could do is take little s

1395
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:35,872
and multiply it by big G.

1396
01:00:35,872 --> 01:00:36,580
TADGE DRYJA: Yes.

1397
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:37,650
AUDIENCE: And then do some--

1398
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:38,430
TADGE DRYJA: Yeah.

1399
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:41,320
So the basic idea--
yeah, you're right.

1400
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,630
Multiply this side
by G. Then you also

1401
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:46,330
have to multiply the
other side by G, right?

1402
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:50,170
So you say, OK, well,
as the verifier--

1403
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:51,732
I've got R, I've got s--

1404
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:53,590
I multiply s by
G, and now I have

1405
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:57,800
to multiply this side by G.
And what'll that look like?

1406
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,764
Well, what's k times G?

1407
01:00:59,764 --> 01:01:00,264
AUDIENCE: R.

1408
01:01:00,264 --> 01:01:03,490
TADGE DRYJA: R. What's
little a times G?

1409
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:07,140
Big A. So yeah.

1410
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,090
I want to verify.

1411
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:11,490
I want to verify that
this equation was used,

1412
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:15,120
right-- s equals k minus
this hash times little a.

1413
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,490
Multiply both sides
by G, I get s times G

1414
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:21,660
equals k times G minus the
hash thing times little a times

1415
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:26,070
G. This is big A. This is R.

1416
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:29,490
Hey, now I know everything
here as the verifier, right?

1417
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:30,552
I know what s time G is.

1418
01:01:30,552 --> 01:01:31,260
I know what R is.

1419
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,490
I know what big A is.

1420
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:35,593
I know what's going
into this hash function.

1421
01:01:35,593 --> 01:01:36,510
And so I just say, OK.

1422
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:44,130
Well, I rearrange it a little,
and I say, is R equal to this?

1423
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:46,350
And if it is, that's
a good signature.

1424
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:50,620
If it's not, it's
not a good signature.

1425
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:51,900
Any questions about this?

1426
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:56,850
Does this makes sense, mostly?

1427
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:04,620
So for the verification, it's
a bit more CPU-intense, right?

1428
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,030
You're given a scalar.

1429
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:13,270
You multiply by G. You
also have to multiply A--

1430
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:14,720
this is actually more costly--

1431
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,870
you have to multiply
A by this hash.

1432
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:18,370
The reason that's
more costly-- it's

1433
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:20,660
still a scalar times a point.

1434
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:25,060
The thing is, since G is
used for multiplying a lot,

1435
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:29,710
you precompute all sorts
of coefficients times G,

1436
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:34,590
and you store them in RAM
or in your CPU somewhere.

1437
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:36,370
So multiplying by G
is a little bit faster

1438
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:38,620
because you do it a lot,
you can precompute a lot,

1439
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:41,170
whereas multiplying by A is
different each time for all

1440
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:42,610
the different signatures.

1441
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:45,340
So this is a little
bit slower, in general.

1442
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:48,190
So it takes a little
bit more CPU time

1443
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:51,820
to verify a signature
than to create one,

1444
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,660
something like twice as much.

1445
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:55,690
But still, you can
do this pretty fast.

1446
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:59,000
On a modern computer, you can
do thousands of these a second.

1447
01:02:59,000 --> 01:02:59,500
OK.

1448
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,180
Any questions so far?

1449
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:05,800
I'll go a little bit into why
this is not forgible, right?

1450
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:09,220
So I want to forge a signature.

1451
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:14,980
Well, I don't know little a.

1452
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:18,430
But why don't I make up
a k and compute s and R?

1453
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:20,470
But I need a, right?

1454
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:23,140
So I'm going to say, OK,
this is the equation I want.

1455
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:28,120
I'll just make up my own
k and make up my own k, s,

1456
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,000
that'll satisfy this.

1457
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,670
Without a, I really can't
make a valid s, right?

1458
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:34,945
I can make something up here.

1459
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:42,400
But I can't compute it because
I don't know here, right?

1460
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,260
I can try to grind through hash
functions, but it won't work.

1461
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:48,040
The basic problem
is if I make up an s

1462
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,860
and solve for R, right--

1463
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,780
I can say, well,
I know what R is--

1464
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:56,413
but the thing is R is in
the hash function, as well.

1465
01:03:56,413 --> 01:03:58,330
It's the one-wayness of
the hash function that

1466
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:01,142
actually breaks this, right?

1467
01:04:01,142 --> 01:04:03,100
So I could say, well,
let me solve for R. Well,

1468
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:10,710
R is the hash of m and R
times a plus s times G.

1469
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:13,980
If I can come up with a
valid R here, I can do this.

1470
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:19,650
The problem is R is defined
by the hash of R in this case.

1471
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:22,630
I can't compute this, and I
can't cancel this out, right?

1472
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:25,920
So you can see just like, OK,
I need to solve for R. Well,

1473
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,450
but it's already in here.

1474
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:28,440
I'm stuck.

1475
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:32,480
If I don't know k, I can't come
up with a signature, either.

1476
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:37,610
OK.

1477
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:40,940
There is one footgun
with EC signatures.

1478
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:46,160
If you use the same R value
for different signatures

1479
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,130
with the same pubkey, you
reveal your private key.

1480
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:53,420
So k has to be random
and new every time.

1481
01:04:56,515 --> 01:04:57,890
If you look through
the equation,

1482
01:04:57,890 --> 01:04:59,705
you'll see how you can solve--

1483
01:04:59,705 --> 01:05:05,150
if you have two of the same
k's with different s's--

1484
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:06,770
you can solve for k.

1485
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:11,910
And then, once you
solve for k given

1486
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:15,030
this, if you know
what k is, you can

1487
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:17,400
find what little a is,
right, as a verifier.

1488
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,680
You can say, well,
you gave me s.

1489
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,090
That's part of the signature.

1490
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:23,760
I know this whole coefficient.

1491
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,410
If I know k, I can solve for
little a by dividing this out.

1492
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:29,220
So always use a new k value.

1493
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,980
There have been many
cases where people don't.

1494
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:37,020
Probably the most famous one
is PlayStation 3 used ECDSA.

1495
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:40,470
And they used a fixed k value
for signing all their code.

1496
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:43,320
And that allowed people to
calculate their private keys

1497
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,870
and then run pirated games.

1498
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:47,400
That was actually
the first time I

1499
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,594
learned about elliptic
curve signatures,

1500
01:05:49,594 --> 01:05:53,670
in 2010 or something.

1501
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:55,800
So actually, there's
interesting tutorials

1502
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,830
written by the hackers who
broke Playstation 3 about how

1503
01:05:58,830 --> 01:05:59,590
this works.

1504
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:02,500
And that's when I
first read about it.

1505
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,000
OK.

1506
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,370
We're almost out of time.

1507
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:10,090
Any questions about
this stuff so far?

1508
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:11,340
OK.

1509
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:15,787
So this is a
signature algorithm.

1510
01:06:15,787 --> 01:06:16,620
It's like, OK, fine.

1511
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:17,130
This works.

1512
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:20,460
I can sign, same as lamport
signatures, same as RSA.

1513
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:22,530
What's really nice about
the elliptic curve stuff

1514
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:26,580
is you can do more
than just signatures.

1515
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,890
There's all sorts of
fun things you can do.

1516
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:31,380
And it seems like a
fairly unexplored area

1517
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:34,440
in that I've found
fun things that you

1518
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,690
can do that I guess are novel.

1519
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:38,610
And I'm not an expert
on this at all.

1520
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:40,800
It's just that it's a
fairly new area of research

1521
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,920
in how to do cool
bitcoiny cryptocurrency

1522
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,290
things with these curves
and points and stuff.

1523
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:51,900
So I'll go through a couple
fun things you can do.

1524
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,080
Fun with points.

1525
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:53,580
OK.

1526
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,650
So I'm not using an asterisk.

1527
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:59,880
Just b times G.
So let's say Alice

1528
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:04,620
has a public key A. Bob
has a public key B, right,

1529
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:09,300
which is little a times G
or little b times G. Well,

1530
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,470
this is weird.

1531
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:12,970
Little a times big B--

1532
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:16,290
Alice's private key multiplied
by Bob's public key--

1533
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:18,480
you can do that, right?--

1534
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,850
is equal to Bob's private
key times Alice's public

1535
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:23,590
key, right?

1536
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:24,310
It's commutative.

1537
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:25,860
The multiplication
is commutative.

1538
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,030
That's weird, right?

1539
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:30,468
It's just a times G times
b, which is the same--

1540
01:07:30,468 --> 01:07:32,010
or it doesn't matter
the order-- it's

1541
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:36,360
the same as b times G times a,
which is the same as a times

1542
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:40,320
b times G. And let's
call that C. C-- this

1543
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,950
is called a Diffie-Hellman
key exchange point.

1544
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:47,550
Diffie and Hellman are two also
late-'70s PhD students who came

1545
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:49,470
up with all this cool stuff.

1546
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:50,908
No, wait.

1547
01:07:50,908 --> 01:07:51,950
Diffie was a PhD student.

1548
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:52,950
Hellman was his advisor?

1549
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:53,970
I don't remember.

1550
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:57,540
Anyway, they came
up with this idea.

1551
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,340
And this is a shared point.

1552
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:02,450
What would this be useful for?

1553
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:04,070
It's actually super useful.

1554
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:05,485
Can you think of like, oh, OK.

1555
01:08:05,485 --> 01:08:06,110
We can do this.

1556
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:09,170
We can compute C. Why
would we want to do that?

1557
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:11,446
Any applications
you can think of?

1558
01:08:11,446 --> 01:08:12,402
Yeah?

1559
01:08:12,402 --> 01:08:15,270
AUDIENCE: Trying to share
keys with people without both

1560
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:17,182
of them knowing who
they are and evaluating

1561
01:08:17,182 --> 01:08:18,664
the other set of keys.

1562
01:08:18,664 --> 01:08:19,414
TADGE DRYJA: Yeah.

1563
01:08:19,414 --> 01:08:21,979
It's really cool to share keys.

1564
01:08:21,979 --> 01:08:25,609
So this is also done if
you have a web browser.

1565
01:08:25,609 --> 01:08:28,460
I think it's all elliptic curve
Diffie-Hellman now, mostly.

1566
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:30,740
But if you have a web browser
and you go to a website,

1567
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:35,300
this is happening, basically,
for every HTTPS request.

1568
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:37,550
Because you can
use C as a sort of

1569
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:41,750
shared key and encrypt
things with it.

1570
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:45,620
The idea is big A can be public.

1571
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:48,529
Big B can be public.

1572
01:08:48,529 --> 01:08:50,330
Point C will not be public.

1573
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:52,130
The only way to
compute it is to know

1574
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:54,979
either Alice's private
key-- little a--

1575
01:08:54,979 --> 01:08:58,790
or Bob's private key, little b.

1576
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:02,270
Even though you can
see the public keys,

1577
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:06,470
you can't compute C from
just the public keys, right?

1578
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:12,229
Because big A times big
B, that's not defined.

1579
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:13,910
You can't multiply the points.

1580
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:16,670
You have to multiply
the point by a scalar.

1581
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:18,260
And since you don't
know the scalars

1582
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:20,450
from viewing this
exchange, you can't

1583
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:23,810
compute C. But Alice and
Bob can both compute C.

1584
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:25,710
So this is really useful.

1585
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:30,229
You can compute C. You
can use it for encryption.

1586
01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:33,319
You can use it to prove you
are who you say you are.

1587
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:36,200
You can use it as an
interactive verification

1588
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,300
where you say, OK, I'm Bob.

1589
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:41,680
I'm going to make random point.

1590
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,930
I'm going to give that to you.

1591
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:46,680
Prove you know your
private key-- little a--

1592
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:50,439
by telling me what C is, right?

1593
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:54,880
So I can make a random
key here, give it to you.

1594
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,340
You return C. I verify that
that's the right C. And I say,

1595
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:00,460
OK, well you must know little a.

1596
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:03,100
You haven't shown me
a little a, but you've

1597
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,260
proven that you know it,
so proof of knowledge

1598
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:06,680
of the private key.

1599
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:11,000
So you can use that for
logins instead of passwords.

1600
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,280
And it's much simpler
than a signature.

1601
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,180
So that's really cool.

1602
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:17,920
All sorts of things
you can do with that.

1603
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,990
The last part, you can
have fun with points.

1604
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:22,690
And I use this in my software.

1605
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:25,090
So you say, OK, well,
there's a public key A.

1606
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:27,430
There's a public
key B. And we'll

1607
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:32,590
define D as the sum of
these two public keys.

1608
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:35,110
The thing is if you're
summing these two public keys,

1609
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:36,820
it's commutative,
and it is the same

1610
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:41,890
as saying the sum of the two
private keys times G, right?

1611
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:45,910
a times G plus b times
G is the same as a plus

1612
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:50,650
b times G, which is another
really cool property.

1613
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:54,310
So what if I compute
this public key D,

1614
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:59,410
and I say I want a
signature from public key D?

1615
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:00,130
You can.

1616
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,900
And you so the
private key, little d,

1617
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:07,060
which can sign for this, is
just little a plus little b.

1618
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:09,192
So you can make a combined key.

1619
01:11:09,192 --> 01:11:10,150
And then either party--

1620
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:14,260
Alice has little a,
Bob has a little b--

1621
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:16,000
and they could reveal
it to each other

1622
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,750
and allow the other person to
make a signature with D later.

1623
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,010
I use this in the lightning
network software I've had,

1624
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:30,670
where, basically, you say,
look, we'll compute D,

1625
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:36,150
and I can give you the
private key, right?

1626
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:36,750
I'm Bob.

1627
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,330
And I say, OK, here's point b.

1628
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:40,270
Here's point a.

1629
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:41,700
We add them together.

1630
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:45,030
And then, Alice, if I give
you my private key, now

1631
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:47,550
you can sign, but
I can't, right?

1632
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:50,610
So I'll give you
the private key to D

1633
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:52,170
from some information I have.

1634
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:54,030
Or you could give me
the private key to D

1635
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:56,370
by sharing little a with me.

1636
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:58,020
So this is another
useful thing where

1637
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:00,150
you can have something
where both parties know

1638
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:03,120
that neither party can
sign unless they give them

1639
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,110
something.

1640
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:09,450
And you can use that for bitcoin
addresses, things like that.

1641
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,610
Before you even
get to signatures,

1642
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:13,000
you can share keys and stuff.

1643
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,390
There's all sorts
of super fun things

1644
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:18,690
you can do with these points
and curves and systems.

1645
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:22,860
Multisignatures-- I put
a link to a PDF file

1646
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:26,760
that's very recent and kind
of overkill and over my head,

1647
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,530
as well.

1648
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:31,600
But you can do signatures where
you aggregate the signatures.

1649
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,100
But

1650
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,333
There's ways to
say, OK, well, I'm

1651
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:36,000
going to add all these
R points, and I'm

1652
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,333
going to add all these s points.

1653
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:39,900
And I can have
signatures that are

1654
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:41,820
from a bunch of
different people that

1655
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:44,940
collapse into the same
size as a single signature.

1656
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,490
And I can verify that they're
all signing the same thing

1657
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:49,860
or, possibly, that they're
all signing different things.

1658
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:52,410
So I have 10
different signatures

1659
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:55,260
from different people
signing different messages.

1660
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:57,220
But I can add up
all the s values.

1661
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:58,440
I have to keep the R values.

1662
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,710
But now these 10 signatures,
instead of being 64 bytes

1663
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,840
each are more like
32 bites each.

1664
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,360
And there's one extra 32
byte value for all of them.

1665
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,970
So there's a lot
of really cool ways

1666
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:12,330
you can combine things,
make things smaller,

1667
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:14,920
make things really versatile,
where we can share keys,

1668
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:17,250
things like that,
which you can't

1669
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:20,670
do with hash-based
signatures, hash functions.

1670
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:22,170
And so it's really fun.

1671
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:24,240
One worry is that if
quantum computers ever

1672
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,850
become really a thing, all
this stuff stops working.

1673
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:29,070
All the elliptic curve
stuff doesn't work anymore.

1674
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:31,950
You can figure out what
people's private keys are,

1675
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:34,320
whereas hash stuff, hash
things like lamport signatures,

1676
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,060
still work.

1677
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:38,460
So there's some talk
of hey, we should

1678
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:42,360
prepare for if that ever happens
and make efficient, effective

1679
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,520
hash-based signatures
and use them

1680
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,608
in something like
Bitcoin or Ethereum.

1681
01:13:46,608 --> 01:13:48,900
People haven't yet because
the overhead is really high.

1682
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,940
It's really big.

1683
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:52,710
The real thing is
all these fun things

1684
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:55,270
might disappear in
the next 10, 20 years.

1685
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:55,770
Who knows?

1686
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:56,880
But there's lots of cool stuff.

1687
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:57,880
What do we do with this?

1688
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,760
So we're not going
to do anything yet

1689
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,350
in terms of problem sets.

1690
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:03,540
It's a little hard to
program it directly.

1691
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:04,730
But there's libraries.

1692
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:06,355
And the libraries
have fairly easy use,

1693
01:14:06,355 --> 01:14:08,980
where it's multiply
by G is a function,

1694
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:11,140
and multiply by this
point is a function.

1695
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,140
So this is groundwork for
cool stuff you can do.

1696
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:15,420
And it's really nice
because it's a new area.

1697
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:18,570
And I'm not an expert on this,
but I've come up with stuff

1698
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:20,640
that people have cited me on.

1699
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,350
And they're like, yeah, I guess
no one thought of that before.

1700
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:25,240
There's a lot of things.

1701
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,760
There's one very
recent one called

1702
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,453
Taproot, where it's one line.

1703
01:14:28,453 --> 01:14:29,370
You're like, oh, yeah.

1704
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:30,750
That works.

1705
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:33,930
And it's just these sort of
elliptic curve operations.

1706
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:35,220
It's like, yeah, that works.

1707
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,352
That's really useful.

1708
01:14:36,352 --> 01:14:37,560
How did no one think of that?

1709
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,370
It's one line.

1710
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:39,180
Wow.

1711
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:40,320
So there's just
not a ton of people

1712
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,570
working on this kind of stuff.

1713
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:43,490
And so it's kind of fun.
